Please use [`SAMPLE_STARTING_POINT`](SAMPLE_STARTING_POINT) as a starting point.

While it's possible to simply create a standard set of HTML/JS/CSS files within the new directory,
you can take advantage of the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-based templating system to handle
most of the boilerplate.

Follow the [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
guide to mimic the production Jekyll environment during local development.

Once complete, please file a pull request against the `gh-pages` branch with your sample.
It will be reviewed and merged.
